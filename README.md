<p align="center">Welcome to cub3D, a graphic design project that serves as a playground to explore the practical applications of mathematics in the world of computer graphics.
</p>

<p>This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use
of basic algorithms, information research etc.
As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve your skills in these
areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.
To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.
With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, you will use
mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.

## Overview

The **Cub3D project** is a joint effort by myself and my esteemed colleague, **Mohamed El Kabbaj**, aimed at creating an immersive 3D graphical experience. Drawing inspiration from the iconic "Wolfenstein 3D" game, our canvas boasts fluid player movement, a dynamic Minimap, captivating textures, and intricate walls.

## Project Highlights

### RayCasting and PixelByPixel Precision

Our exploration led us to embrace the **#RayCasting** concept, opting for pixel-by-pixel precision over the conventional Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) technique. In the realm of computer graphics, we projected rays from the observer's viewpoint to create a captivating interaction with the three-dimensional scene.

### The Role of MiniLibX

Our journey was complemented by the use of the **C programming language's Minilibx library**. This small graphics library enabled screen creation and rendering without delving into the complexities of Cocoa and X-Window. Its minimalist design provides straightforward window creation, an engaging drawing tool, and a distinctive event management system.

## Acknowledgments

I extend my sincere gratitude to **Mohamed El Kabbaj**, my invaluable project partner, whose unwavering commitment and insightful contributions have been integral to our shared journey. Together, we ventured beyond the traditional DDA algorithm, embracing the intricacies of PixelByPixel to enhance control and accuracy.

## Learning and Growth

This project stands as a testament to the remarkable process of learning and growth. As our expedition continues, we eagerly anticipate uncovering further insights into the fascinating world of 3D graphics.

Feel free to explore our codebase and join us on this exciting journey into the depths of Cub3D!
