<p align="center">Welcome to cub3D, a graphic design project that serves as a playground to explore the practical applications of mathematics in the world of computer graphics.
</p>

<p>This project’s objectives are similar to all this first year’s objectives: Rigor, use of C, use
of basic algorithms, information research etc.
As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable you to improve your skills in these
areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.
To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics.
With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, you will use
mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.
